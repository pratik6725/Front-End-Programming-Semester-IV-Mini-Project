Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to </br> effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.</br> It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on </br>sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly </br>programmed to perform the task.:2 Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, </br>such as email filtering, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions </br>for performing the task. Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on </br>making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and </br>application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, and </br>focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. In its application across business </br>problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.
